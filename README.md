## description

This is a basic Rubik's Cube trainer that contains a list of algorithms for CFOP, as well as trainers to help memorize and internalize these algorithms.

## status
- [ ] Standard solving
- [x] OLL practice
- [x] PLL practice
- [x] Algorithm viewer

## development

Follow the `npm` and `CLI` instructions of the [Vue
guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html) to run a dev server.

## attribution
assistant uses [Vue.js 1.0](http://vuejs.org/), [Skeleton 2.0.4](http://getskeleton.com/) and a Makise Kurisu .gif from [Phantom Breaker Battle Grounds](http://5pb.jp/games/pbbg/en/character_4.html).

Most of the algorithms used (including the diagrams) are from [Bob Burton's cubewhiz.com](http://www.cubewhiz.com/). There were a few that were swapped out/rotated at some point; unfortunately I don't remember when or where they came from.
